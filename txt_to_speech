###to read the contacts name one a "match" is found


if (customers_name) = true then input = false
elif (customers voice) = false then input = true


from gtts import gTTS 
import os
import names from pypi
fn = ('') #first name
ln = ('') #last name

language = 'en'

##need to designate where to print

print = (fn)
print = (ln)


myobj = gTTS(text=mytext1,mytext2, lang=language, slow=False)

####the below lines are wrong and I will need to change it from mp3 to direct to the bluetooth speaker####


myobj.save("welcome.mp3")
os.system("mpg321 welcome.mp3")
