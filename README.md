Trial
Goal is to have a small camera to be worn at all time (size of a shirt button) that captures fascial recognition of the people you meet and adds them to your contact list. Next time you meet the same person your phone or smart watch alerts you and lets you know who it is along with the last time you met them and where. 
I have no computer experience and no knowledge of programming so all of this is new to me, I am trying to learn as I hopefully develop this program.
